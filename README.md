## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project follows a standard ASP.NET Core Web API structure:

- `Controllers/`: Contains API controllers for handling HTTP requests.
- `Data/`: Includes the <mcsymbol name="ApplicationDbContext" filename="ApplicationDbContext.cs" path="Streamflix/Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs" startline="8" type="class"></mcsymbol> for database interactions and migrations.
- `DTOs/`: Data Transfer Objects for request/response models.
- `Migrations/`: Entity Framework Core database migrations.
- `Middleware/`: Custom middleware (e.g., error handling).
- `Model/`: Defines the data entities.
- `Services/`: Business logic and service layer components (e.g., <mcsymbol name="TokenService" filename="TokenService.cs" path="Streamflix/Services/TokenService.cs" startline="8" type="class"></mcsymbol>, <mcsymbol name="EmailService" filename="EmailService.cs" path="Streamflix/Services/EmailService.cs" startline="10" type="class"></mcsymbol>).
- `Properties/`: Project settings, including `launchSettings.json`.
- `deployment/`: Contains all deployment-related scripts and configurations:
  - `docker/`: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, Nginx configurations.
  - `terraform/`: Terraform scripts (`main.tf`) for AWS infrastructure provisioning.
  - `scripts/`: Helper scripts (e.g., `setup_docker.sh` for EC2 instance).
  - `deploy.sh`: Master deployment script.
- `appsettings.json`: Configuration file for the application.
- `Program.cs`: Application entry point and service configuration.

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is designed for deployment on AWS using a combination of Terraform, Docker, and a custom deployment script.

1.  **Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform):**
    - The <mcfile name="deployment/terraform/main.tf" path="Streamflix/deployment/terraform/main.tf"></mcfile> script provisions the necessary AWS resources:
      - EC2 instance for hosting the application.
      - RDS PostgreSQL instance for the database.
      - Security Groups for network traffic control.
      - Elastic IP for a static public IP address.
2.  **Application Deployment (`deploy.sh`):**
    - The <mcfile name="deployment/deploy.sh" path="Streamflix/deployment/deploy.sh"></mcfile> script automates the entire deployment process:
      - Prompts for AWS credentials and database password.
      - Initializes and applies Terraform configurations.
      - Retrieves outputs like EC2 public IP and RDS endpoint.
      - Configures DNS (manual step guided by the script).
      - Generates a `.env` file with dynamic configuration for Docker Compose.
      - Clones the application repository onto the EC2 instance.
      - Sets up Nginx and Certbot on the EC2 instance.
      - Obtains SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.
      - Updates `appsettings.json` on the EC2 instance with actual database and AWS credentials.
      - Copies the final Nginx configuration (with SSL) to the EC2 instance.
      - Builds and starts the application using Docker Compose (<mcfile name="deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml" path="Streamflix/deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml"></mcfile>).
3.  **Containerization (Docker):**
    - The application and its dependencies (like Nginx) are containerized using Docker.
    - The <mcfile name="deployment/docker/Dockerfile" path="Streamflix/deployment/docker/Dockerfile"></mcfile> defines the build process for the ASP.NET Core application.
    - <mcfile name="deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml" path="Streamflix/deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml"></mcfile> orchestrates the `api`, `nginx`, and `db` services.
4.  **Reverse Proxy & SSL (Nginx & Certbot):**
    - Nginx (<mcfile name="deployment/docker/nginx/nginx.conf" path="Streamflix/deployment/docker/nginx/nginx.conf"></mcfile>) acts as a reverse proxy, handling incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic and forwarding it to the ASP.NET Core application.
    - It also serves static files and handles SSL termination.
    - Certbot is used to automatically obtain and renew SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt, ensuring secure HTTPS communication.

- **Problem Solving:** Designing and implementing a complex system with multiple interconnected components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running Locally (Conceptual)

While this project is primarily designed for AWS deployment, a conceptual local setup would involve:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - .NET 8 SDK
    - Docker Desktop
    - PostgreSQL server (local instance or Docker container)
2.  **Configuration:**
    - Update `appsettings.Development.json` (create if not present) with local PostgreSQL connection string and any other necessary local configurations (e.g., mock API keys for Stripe/Resend if not testing full integration).
3.  **Database:**
    - Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
    - Apply EF Core migrations: `dotnet ef database update`
4.  **Run Application:**
    - `dotnet run` from the `Streamflix` project directory.

**Note:** For full functionality (S3, Stripe, Resend), you would need to configure local alternatives or connect to actual development accounts for these services. The `deploy.sh` script is the recommended way to experience the full application.

## üåê API Endpoints

The application exposes various API endpoints for interacting with its features. These are documented using Swagger, which can typically be accessed at `/swagger` on the deployed API URL (e.g., `https://api.streamsflix.online/swagger`).

Key endpoint groups include:

- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication and User Registration
- `/api/admin/*` - Admin functionalities
- `/api/videos/*` - Video management
- `/api/files/*` - S3 file and show management
- `/api/buckets/*` - S3 bucket management
- `/api/subscription/*` - Stripe subscription handling
- `/api/watch-history/*` - User watch history
- `/api/favorite-videos/*` - User favorite videos
- `/api/user/*` - User profile

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Implement a full CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- Add advanced video search and filtering capabilities.
- Develop a recommendation engine based on user preferences and watch history.
- Introduce user reviews and ratings for videos.
- Explore live streaming capabilities.
- Enhance admin dashboard with more analytics and content management tools.
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.
